1) mean vs average?
2) Learn about bell cureve?
3) what is model?
4) loss funciton?

* Machine Learning is an accurate prediction of parameter(s) of probability distribution of dependent variable on a 
  condition that the dependent variable is dependent on input features.


Relative Frequency:
It is not stable or constant.

RF becomes probability when the sample is very very large.

Frequentist:
who thinks of probability in terms of frequency.

Bayesian:
oppsite of frequentist.


Probability Distribution:
when we mark the probability of a variable on a graph, the graph is known as PD.

* Normal Distribution(Bell Curve): It is a part of our live,most of the data forms NM at populaiton level.
  -mean has the highest probability.
  - two parts: mean, standard deviation.


Might not be correct
-all the columns on the basis of which a random variable's probability is calculated is known as input feature.
-The varible who's probabiltiy we are trying to find is known as target feature aka dependent variable.
